# Formula One Data Ingestion Project
## Overview
This project automates the ingestion, processing, and normalization of Formula One race data from the Open F1 API (api.openf1.org). The data is extracted from the API using an AWS Lambda function, stored in an S3 bucket, and then ingested into Snowflake for further normalization and storage in a final database.
