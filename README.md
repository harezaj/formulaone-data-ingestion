# Formula One Data Ingestion Project
## Overview
This project automates the ingestion, processing, and normalization of Formula One race data from various sources. The data is collected from the api.openf1.org API, stored in an S3 bucket, processed by AWS Lambda functions, and then ingested into Snowflake for further normalization and storage in a final database.
